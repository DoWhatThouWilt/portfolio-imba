### Multi-Page Moving Form

I created a multi-step form for moving comapnies that collects the nessesary customer information for
the moving job, and beyond that it takes inventory of the objects that need to moved, and would use this inventory to calculate
an estimate for the customer. First, the form collects the basic customer contact information,
then secondly collects more specific details about the moving sites that ensures the movers' will have sufficient information to preform
their job smoothly. Next, it allows the customer to input a list of rooms, tally the furniture items respective to each room and order boxes.
Finally, the form presents a summary of the furniture items and boxes, allowing the customer to make changes to thier list before
submitting their information.

The form I created for moving companies is a multi-step process that takes the necessary customer information and inventory of objects needing moved. It would collect this data about where they need their items moved to ensures movers will have all required knowledge before performing job smoothly!  First off you'll need your basic contact details like name or phone number; then more specific stuff about where things are going - how many rooms does this move include? What type if furniture do we have in each space? The form presents a summary of the furniture items and boxes, allowing customers to make changes before submitting their information.

### Moving Leads Form

I created a wordpress plugin that provides users with an easy-to-use form on the frontend, seamlessly connected to their backend data. The admin panel for this plug in can be used by admins or administrators of your company's CRM application to view customer information collected from leads submitted via our own custom designedÂ forms.

The frontend form is made with Imba. The admin panel is made with Svelte. The business logic of the plugin uses Wordpress' REST API to store and retrieve data. The leads from the form are both stored in the
wordpress database and sent to a moving CRM.  The admin panel is capable of exporting the data in a CSV file, and sending email notifications when new
leads are submitted.
